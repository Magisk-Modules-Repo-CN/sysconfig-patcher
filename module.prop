description=Systemlessly patches all relevant XML files in /system/etc/sysconfig for data and battery savings & auto-re-patches across ROM/GApps updates. Thus, these packages (i.e., Google Play Services) will no longer have unrestricted access to data & power intensive resources without the user's explicit consent. Doze and data saver will act upon them. Important packages such as Qualcomm's, Download Manager, etc., are not affected.
