# Sysconfig Patcher
# VR25 @ XDA Developers

- Systemlessly patches /system/etc/sysconfig/* for data & battery savings.
- Re-patches automatically after ROM/GApps updates.

- If you're familiar with "DozeGMS" or similar module/tweak, well -- Sysconfig Patcher goes even further. In addition to "google.xml," it also patches ALL the other XML files found in /system/etc/sysconfig, systemlessly.
- This way, no package listed in these files will ever have unrestricted access to data & power intensive resources without the user's explicit consent.

- Remove any similar mod before or after installing this one.
