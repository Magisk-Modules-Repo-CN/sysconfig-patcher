# Sysconfig Patcher
# VR25 @ XDA Developers

- Systemlessly patches "/system/etc/sysconfig/*" for data & battery savings.
- Re-patches automatically after ROM/GApps updates.
- If you're familiar with "DozeGMS" or similar module/tweak, this one does the same, but... in addition to "google.xml," it also patches ALL the other XML files inside /system/etc/sysconfig, systemlessly!
- This way, no app will ever have unrestricted access to data & power intensive resources without the user's explicit consent.
